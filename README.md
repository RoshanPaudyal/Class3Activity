## My Introduction
    I am Roshan paudyal. I am a finance cordinator. My backgroudn is accounting and finance.

    I want to be a either be a freelancer one day and help small businesses digitalize and move from traditional finance to Fintech or work with a team and build something really affordable which will bring a revolution for people especially small business(developing countries) with knowledge of local market but lack the expertise in technology and dont have enough budget to hire or buy one. 

    I choose **fintech** as career path because fintech is the future. The way business are run are same ,all the business have a goal but the way they are operated and managed is changing and if i dont upskill myself as required in market, it will be impossible for me to grow inside the organisation.
